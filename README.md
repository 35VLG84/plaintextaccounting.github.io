# The plaintextaccounting.org website

This is the source for [plaintextaccounting.org](http://plaintextaccounting.org),
an information portal/overview site for Plain Text Accounting and
related tools: Ledger, hledger, beancount, etc.

The repo is named `plaintextaccounting.github.io` to make it the
Github Pages site for the 
[plaintextaccounting organization](https://github.com/plaintextaccounting/), 
allowing it to be served with the custom `plaintextaccounting.org` domain.

### How to contribute an update (using web UI)

(Ok for trivial updates)

1. Log in to Github and click the pencil at
   [index.md](https://github.com/plaintextaccounting/plaintextaccounting.github.io/blob/master/index.md).
2. Make your changes to the markdown source. Commit.
3. Make the corresponding changes in the generated [index.html](https://github.com/plaintextaccounting/plaintextaccounting.github.io/blob/master/index.html). Commit.
   It's ok to skip this step if you must; we'll update the html for you.
4. These commits will be bundled into a pull request (I think). 
   Or will be applied immediately if you have commit access.

### How to contribute an update (using pandoc)

1. Log in to Github, fork this repo, clone it to your machine.
3. Make your changes to `index.md` (and/or `README.md`, `css/*`, `images/*`).
4. Regenerate `index.html` as follows:
   - Ensure you have [pandoc] 2.5+ and [GNU Make] installed, and run `make`. (Preferred).
   - If you don't have GNU Make, you can run
     `pandoc -f markdown-smart+autolink_bare_uris --template index.tmpl index.md -o index.html`
   - If you don't have pandoc, you can update `index.html` by hand (ok for trivial changes).
4. Commit the changes (source files and regenerated html files, eg both `index.md` and `index.html`).
5. `git push` to your fork.
6. Submit a pull request.

### How to get commit access

If you're a recurring contributor and haven't yet been granted commit access, 
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/plaintextaccounting/plaintextaccounting.github.io/issues/new?title=Contributor+requesting+commit+bit&body=Request+for+commit+access)
to request it.

### How to see a live local preview

1. Install [entr] and [livereloadx]
2. In one window, `make liverender` to update index.html
3. In another window, `make livereload` to run a live-reloading local webserver
4. Open the page in a browser: http://localhost:10000
5. Save changes in `index.md`, see updates in the browser.

### How to use pandoc with container (without installing it)

Some distros don't carry resent enough version of [pandoc]. In that case it is possible
to run `pandoc` with container without installing pandoc into your system.

Below is an example how to do that with [podman].

```
podman run \
  --rm \
  --volume "`pwd`:/data:Z" \
  docker://pandoc/core:latest \
  -f markdown-smart+autolink_bare_uris --template index.tmpl index.md -o index.html
```

Above command is missing `pandoc` by purpose because it's default target for pandoc container.
